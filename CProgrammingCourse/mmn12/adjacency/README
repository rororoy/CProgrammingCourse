In this directory you'll find the main executable (prog) and tests in the test directory
Test 1 (i1) is the same matrix from the question for N = 11, to run easily:
./prog < ./tests/i1
>> Output is stored in tests/o1 <<

Test 2 (i2) is a 6x6 matrix, does some more path checks for a certain graph
Note: i2 shows it can handle faulty input buy clearing the buffer and terminating
at EOF correctly instead of only at -1 -1.
To run it:
./prog < ./tests/i2
>> Output is stored in tests/o2 <<

You can run the program easily without any tester file:
./prog
