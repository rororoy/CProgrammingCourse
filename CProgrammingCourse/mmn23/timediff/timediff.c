  * Program Name: MMN 23  - TIME DIFFERENCE

  * Description:
    This program reads lines from a given file, for each line of expected 12 numbers:
    6 for each time: 3 for the date and 3 for the hour: DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS
    it extracts the numbers and builds two time objects and prints and calculates in
    seconds the difference in seconds between the two times

  * Variables and data structures:
      1. time object defined in the header file: containes two objects: month and date
      2. months object contains and representing in 3 numbers a date: DD.MM.YYYY
      3. hours object contains and representing in 3 numbers an hour: HH:MM:SS
      4. days per month: stores number of days in each month in an array, each
      index holds the days of that month(minus 1 ==> 0 is jan...)

    * Algorithm:
      1. Validates command structures by scanning the passed additional arguments
      2. Reads the file passed line by line
      3. for each line containing 12 numbers representing two time objects:
      4. extract the input and build the two time objects
      5. calculate the difference between the two time objects in the time_diff function
        - does so by finding out which time is sooner
        - for each time calculates how many days passed from the date to the end of the epoch (00/00/0000)
        - when its known there is no year 0 between years 1 and -1
        - converts the days to an amount of seconds difference
        - for each hour of a time calcualtes the seconds passed from 00:00
        - adds the two results for each time, calculates the difference between the two results,
         the later time minus the sooner
         - returns the result
      6. prints the result


    * Input:
      Commands in the format ./timediff <filename>
      Format of the time in the file for each line: DD MM YY HH MM SS DD MM YY HH MM SS --> <time #1> <time #2>

    * Output:
      Prints the difference between the two dates in each line in seconds

    * Notes:
      Eample input tests can be found in the same directory as this program. See README.
      Assumes input is valid and no need to check for validity inside file
