In this directory you'll find the main executable (mycomp) and tests in the test directory
Test 1 (i1) is the same test from the question from the part where all types of errors are mentioned:
To run it:
./mycomp < ./tests/i1
>> Output is stored in tests/o1 <<

Test 2 (i2) is the test file that sits at the end of the question
To run it:
./mycomp < ./tests/i2
>> Output is stored in tests/o2 <<

You can run the program easily without any tester file:
./mycomp
